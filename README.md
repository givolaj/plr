# PLRs

Generate Latin Rectangles,
in all sizes and shapes.

empty - generates an empty rectangle, and fills it up, up to about 75%

full - generate a full rectangle, and ommit some symbols

non-trivial - generate a non-trivial PLR, with a non-trivial permutation on rows, cols and symbols, that takes it back to the original
