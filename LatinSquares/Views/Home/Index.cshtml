        In combinatorial mathematics, a <b>Latin rectangle</b> is an n × m matrix, using n symbols, usually digits and letters, where no symbol occurring more than once in any row or column.<br />
        A <b>partial Latin rectangle (PLR)</b> is a Latin rectangle where some of the entries are empty <small>(marked as a dot in this website)</small>.<br />
        The name "Latin square" was inspired by mathematical papers by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler" target="_blank">Leonhard Euler</a> (1707–1783), who used Latin characters as symbols.

        <b>Why do we care about PLRs?</b>
        <br/>1.	We love Euler 😊
        <br/>2.	PLRs have applications in games and puzzles (e.g. sudoku)
        <br/>3.	PLRs are used in cyber security and Cryptography
        <br/>4.	Currently there’s no official platform for generating PLRs data for research, and we like giving back to the community

        <b>What questions are there in the field of PLRs?</b><br/>
        even the simple question of how many full Latin squares (n × n) are is only answered to the order of n=11.. to this day there is no answer for n>=12.<br/>
        But the question that drove my thesis, and still holds my mind, is this:<br />
        lets define a permutation in PLRs as a swap between rows, columns or symbols. Something like swap row 1 and 2 is a permutation.<br />
        lets say we have a PLR x and a set of permutations {a,b,c} on its rows, columns and symbols accordingly, that is not trivial, and when you apply {a,b,c} on x you get x.<br />
        what special traits (besides being beautiful) do those groups have?<br />
        and how fast can we determine if a PLR belongs in that group?<br />
        those are some of the questions that inspired this website
